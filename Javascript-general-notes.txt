-> Whenever we input any data from user through anything like command prompt, we get it in a string format. Therefore, to get any data in number format, we have to use Number() function.

-> There are multiple ways to input any value to the console, they are -
    1) console.log()
    2) console.warn()
    3) console.error()
    4) console.table() - This is best to view large objects

-> For input tags of HTML, we have to use ".value" instead of ".textContent", to get their value given by user.

-> We can use escaping "\" while writing a string.
Example - const myCall = 'Let\'s order a pasta'; To prevent ending the string earlier, we used "\".

-> Iterables - All the data structures other than objects.

-> Whenever a method is called on a string, it is converted to an object and then back to string.

-> Primitive don't mutate.

-> When we pass a primitive type as an argument on a function, the function makes a copy of the ORIGINAL VALUE, and works with it.

-> On the other hand, when we pass an object as an argument on a function, the function makes a copy of the REFERENCE that points to the place of the memory where the object is stored. This copy is a value itself, is not a reference. Because all of this, the original object can be modified from inside of a function.

-> JavaScript is diff -
    -> In programming languages, Arguments can be passed by value, or passed by reference

    -> JS has not passing by reference, only passing by value...

    -> So, when we pass primitive values, the function works with a value, which is a copy of the original value

    -> When we pass an object, the function works with a value that address to the spot where the original object is in the memory (still is not a reference)
